===========================
A parametric ping pong paddle (or table tennis racket) with support for many different handle styles and blade shapes.

```
handle_length = 100;
handle_style = "straight";
handle_thickness = 25;
handle_width = 35;
handle_offset = 0;

blade_width = 150;
blade_length = 160;
blade_thickness = 6;
blade_shape = "pear";
```
